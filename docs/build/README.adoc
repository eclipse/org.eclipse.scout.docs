= Scout Docs - Build

== Description

This folder contains the documents that are build.

* `scout_helloworld`: produces an article as single page to explain how to create an demo application (the html version is published on the scout webpage).
* `scout_install`: produces an article as single page to explain how to downlaod the scout IDE (the html version is published on the scout webpage).
* `beginners_guide`: produces a book called "Eclipse Scout Beginners Guide".
* `technical_guide`: produces a book called "Eclipse Scout: Technical Guide".
* `scout_migration`: produces an article called "Eclipse Scout: Migration Guide".
* `eclipse_help`: produces the necessary pages for the "Eclipse Scout User Guide" (in the `org.eclipse.scout.sdk.s2e.doc` plugin). **IMPORTANT**: The list of pages needs to be kept up to date and ordered in link:eclipse_help/help-pages.txt[help-pages.txt]. In case  `help-pages.txt` gets out of sync with the available `*.adoc` source files the Maven publish step may fail.
* `publish`: this last step prepares all the documents in order to publish them (post processing of the Asciidoctor documents). You should run the other tasks, before running this task.

== Usage

You can generate all documents using maven at the root of the `build` folder:

 mvn

You can generate one document by switching to one of subfolder and using maven:

 cd scout_helloworld/
 mvn

The results are generated in the `target` subfolder. For example for `scout_helloworld`:

 scout_helloworld/target/generated-docs/scout_helloworld.html
 scout_helloworld/target/generated-docs/scout_helloworld.pdf
