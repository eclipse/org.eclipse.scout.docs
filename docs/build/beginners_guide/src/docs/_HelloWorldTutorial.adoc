== "`Hello World`" Tutorial

The "`Hello World`" chapter walks you through the creation of an Eclipse Scout client server application.
When the user starts the client part of this application, the client connects to the server.footnote:[
The Scout server part of the "`Hello World`" application will be running on a web server.
]
and asks for some text content that is to be displayed to the user.
Next, the server retrieves the desired information and sends it back to the client.
The client then copies the content obtained from the server into a text field widget.
Finally, the client displays the message obtained from the server in a text field widget.

The goal of this chapter is to provide a first impression of working with the Scout framework using the Scout SDK.
We will start by building the application from scratch and then we'll deploy the complete application to a Tomcat web server.

=== Installation and Setup

Before you can start with the "`Hello World`" example you need to have a complete and working Scout installation.
For this, see the step-by-step installation guide provided in Appendix <<apx-install_scout>>.
Once you have everything installed, you are ready to create your first Scout project.
