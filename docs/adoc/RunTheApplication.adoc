After the initial project creation step we can start the Scout application for the first time.
For this, the following three steps are necessary

. Start the Scout backend server
. Start the Scout frontend server
. Open the application in the browser

To start the Scout backend server we first select the `[webapp] dev server.launch` file in the Package Explorer view
of the Eclipse IDE and then use the [menu]_Run As_ menu as shown in <<img-start_client>>.

Starting the Scout frontend server works exactely the same.
But first select the `[webapp] dev ui.launch` file in the Eclipse IDE.
This launch file is located under module `helloworld.ui.html.app.dev` in the Package Explorer.

During startup of the Scout applications you should see console output providing information about the startup.
After having successfully started the Scout backend and frontend servers the Hello World application can then be accessed by navigating to http://localhost:8082/ in your favorite web browser.

The running Hello World application should then be started in your browser as shown in <<img-start_browser>>.
