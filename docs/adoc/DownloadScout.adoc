=== Java and Maven

Before you download Scout make sure that you have a working Java Development Kit (JDK) and a working Maven installation.
In case you first need to download and install a JDK we recommend to work with either the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle JDK] or the http://openjdk.java.net/install/[Open JDK].
For Maven, head over to the https://maven.apache.org/[Maven project page].

To verify your Java installation use your command line.

----
C:\Users\mzi>java -version
java version "1.8.0_92"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_92-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.92-b14, mixed mode)
----

We recommend to use a JDK version 8.
Take note of the fact if your JDK is a 64-bit or a 32-bit installation.
In case your version text does not explicitly mention a 64-bit version your JDK is 32-bit installation.

Now check your Maven installation on the command line as well.

----
C:\Users\mzi>mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.2.3 (33f8c3e1027c3ddde99d3cdebad2656a31e8fdf4; 2014-08-11T22:58:10+02:00)
Maven home: C:\maven\apache-maven-3.2.3
Java version: 1.8.0_92, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: C:\java\jdk1.8.0_92\jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: Cp1252
