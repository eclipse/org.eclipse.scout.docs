== Overview

Scout is a framework for creating modern business applications.
Such applications are typically separated into multiple tiers where each tier is responsible for a specific part of the application like presenting information to the user or processing business logic and persisting data.
Scout solves these requirements by providing a separation of such tiers out of the box.

A typical Scout application consists of the following parts:

* A server layer responsible for persisting data on a database and possibly providing and consuming webservices. The scout server layer provides utilities to simplify the most common tasks.
* A client layer responsible for handling the java UI code. It consists of a model represented by plain java classes as well as services and utilities to implement behaviour associeted with client code.
 The scout client layer provides utilities to simplify the most common tasks. For simplicity, the client model is processed in a single threaded way to avoid synchronization.
  Callbacks, e.g. for validating a field or calling services when opening a form run inside a <<ModelJobs,model job>>.
* A UI layer responsible for rendering the client model in the browser. Since the scout UI layer already provides javascript/html/css code for many common UIs, the project specific code in this layer is typically quite small. Examples are specific css styling or a new custom input field for special purposes.

Server and client both run in a servlet container, such as link:http://tomcat.apache.org[Apache Tomcat]. They are usually deployed as separate war files in order to be able to scale them differently. However, it is also possible to create a single war file.
